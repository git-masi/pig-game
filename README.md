This game is based off a project I saw in Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course. My version has a unique visual design, uses modern CSS layout techniques and makes the code a bit more DRY.

The rules are simple:
  Players take turns rolling the die
  Each roll is added to the player's roune score
  At any time a player can hold 
  If the player holds the round score is added to their total score (global score)
  Holding ends the players turn
  If the player rolls a 1 the round score is cleared, nothing is added to the total score, and the player's turn ends
  Play to 100 or some other set of rules
